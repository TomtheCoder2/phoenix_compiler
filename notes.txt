Proper Executable: Modify main generation (or add a C wrapper) to correctly print the result using printf.
Standard Library: Provide built-in functions (like print) (and also a way to make custom library functions in a way such that other users can easily implement their own without knwoing the internals of the compiler).
More Types: Add integers, booleans, maybe strings.
Mutable Variables: Change let to immutable by default and add var for mutable variables (requires careful handling of store in codegen).
Control Flow: Implement if/else statements, while or for loops (requires generating LLVM branches and blocks).
Arrays/Lists: Add data structures.
Return Statement: Add an explicit return keyword.
Type Checking: Implement a semantic analysis phase between parsing and codegen to catch type errors (e.g., adding a number to a function).
Error Reporting: Improve error messages with line/column numbers.
Module System: Allow importing code from other files.
